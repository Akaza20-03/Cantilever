Description

Students analyze movie reviews to classify sentiment as positive or negative. The project involves several steps, including preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and training machine learning models to perform the classification. The goal is to build a system that can accurately predict the sentiment of unseen movie reviews.

Steps Involved

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collecting a dataset of movie reviews.
Cleaning and preprocessing the text data (e.g., removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization).

Feature Extraction:

Converting the text data into numerical features that can be used for machine learning.
Techniques include TF-IDF vectorization, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or using spaCy's built-in features.
Model Training:

Training machine learning models to classify sentiment.
Models used can be traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tuning and optimizing models to improve performance.
