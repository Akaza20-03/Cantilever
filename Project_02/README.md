Explanation
Import necessary libraries:

Libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), machine learning (RandomForestClassifier), evaluation (classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score), and data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn) are imported.
SMOTE from imbalanced-learn is imported to handle imbalanced data.

Load the dataset:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv.
Basic information about the dataset is displayed using df.head() and df.info().

Preprocess the data:

Features (X) and the target (y) are separated.
Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Handle imbalanced data:

SMOTE is used to oversample the minority class and balance the dataset.

Train and evaluate the Random Forest model:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
A Random Forest model is trained using RandomForestClassifier.

Predictions are made on the test set, and the model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
A heatmap is used to visualize the confusion matrix.
